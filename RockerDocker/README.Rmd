# Aims

This is my guide for how to start up rstudio within a docker container locally.


# Download the docker image

```{}
docker pull mathesong/tidyverse-torsten
```

# Run the docker image

```{}
docker run -e PASSWORD=12345 --name rstudio -p 8787:8787 -v C:/Users/mathe/Repositories/Multilevel_TCM:/home/rstudio/Multilevel_TCM mathesong/tidyverse-torsten
```

Also, maybe, if needing to download stuff in the console, might need the following

```{}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE mathesong/tidyverse-torsten
```

And then stuff can be downloaded using

```{}
system("sudo apt-get install -y libgsl0-dev")
```




# Open up the Rstudio session

Open a browser, and enter the following:

```{}
http://localhost:8787/
```

... and then enter the username `rstudio` and the password you wrote above.


# Close the Rstudio image

Find the name of the container - it should be rstudio if you set its name to be that.

```{}
docker container ls
```

Then kill it

```{}
docker kill rstudio
```
