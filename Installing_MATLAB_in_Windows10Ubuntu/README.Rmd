# Aims

Install MATLAB in Windows 10 Ubuntu so that Linux-based software with MATLAB-based components can be run from Windows.

# Installation

This was done before I started writing the guide.  This part needs to be completed when I next do it.

# MATLAB Setup

While MATLAB installs without issue in the Windows 10 Ubuntu environment, opening it is another story.  It has issues with the BLAS libraries.  I found a support page here: https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/308911-can-i-install-matlab-in-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows , and the advice from the user recommending the stuff with execstack worked a charm.


First one needs to install execstack

```{}
sudo apt-get install prelink
```

Then navigate to the MATLAB directory (/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/bin) and run the execstack commands:

```{}
sudo execstack -c glnxa64/libmwblas.so
sudo execstack -c glnxa64/libmwlapack.so
sudo execstack -s glnxa64/MATLAB
```

And then MATLAB works!
